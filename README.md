1. [BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) by Jacob Devlin, Ming-Wei Chang, Kenton Lee and Kristina Toutanova.
2. [Transformer-XL: Attentive Language Models Beyond a Fixed-Length Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.02860) by Zihang Dai, Zhilin Yang, Yiming Yang, William W. Cohen, Jaime Carbonell, Quoc V. Le and Ruslan Salakhutdinov.
  - Uses smart caching to improve the learning of long-term dependency in Transformer. Key results: state-of-art on 5 language modeling benchmarks, including ppl of 21.8 on One Billion Word (LM1B) and 0.99 on enwiki8. The authors claim that the method is more flexible, faster during evaluation (1874 times speedup), generalizes well on small datasets, and is effective at modeling short and long sequences.

  - [Comments from HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20229145):
    <details>
  
    <summary>A clever dual masking-and-caching algorithm.</summary>

    - This is NOT "just throwing more compute" at the problem.
    - The authors have devised a clever dual-masking-plus-caching mechanism to induce an attention-based model to learn to predict tokens from all possible permutations of the factorization order of all other tokens in the same input sequence.
    - In expectation, the model learns to gather information from all positions on both sides of each token in order to predict the token.
      - For example, if the input sequence has four tokens, ["The", "cat", "is", "furry"], in one training step the model will try to predict "is" after seeing "The", then "cat", then "furry".
      - In another training step, the model might see "furry" first, then "The", then "cat".
      - Note that the original sequence order is always retained, e.g., the model always knows that "furry" is the fourth token.
    - The masking-and-caching algorithm that accomplishes this does not seem trivial to me.
    - The improvements to SOTA performance in a range of tasks are significant -- see tables 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 in the paper.

## Transfer Learning in NLP

As Jay Alammar put it:

> The year 2018 has been an inflection point for machine learning models handling text (or more accurately, Natural Language Processing or NLP for short). Our conceptual understanding of how best to represent words and sentences in a way that best captures underlying meanings and relationships is rapidly evolving. Moreover, the NLP community has been putting forward incredibly powerful components that you can freely download and use in your own models and pipelines (It's been referred to as [NLP's ImageNet moment](http://ruder.io/nlp-imagenet/), referencing how years ago similar developments accelerated the development of machine learning in Computer Vision tasks).
>
> One of the latest milestones in this development is the [release](https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/11/open-sourcing-bert-state-of-art-pre.html) of [BERT](https://github.com/google-research/bert), an event [described](https://twitter.com/lmthang/status/1050543868041555969) as marking the beginning of a new era in NLP. BERT is a model that broke several records for how well models can handle language-based tasks. Soon after the release of the paper describing the model, the team also open-sourced the code of the model, and made available for download versions of the model that were already pre-trained on massive datasets. This is a momentous development since it enables anyone building a machine learning model involving language processing to use this powerhouse as a readily-available component – saving the time, energy, knowledge, and resources that would have gone to training a language-processing model from scratch.

> BERT builds on top of a number of clever ideas that have been bubbling up in the NLP community recently – including but not limited to [Semi-supervised Sequence Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.01432) (by [Andrew Dai](https://twitter.com/iamandrewdai) and [Quoc Le](https://twitter.com/quocleix)), [ELMo](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05365) (by Matthew Peters and researchers from [AI2](https://allenai.org/) and [UW CSE](https://www.engr.washington.edu/about/bldgs/cse)), [ULMFiT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06146) (by [fast.ai](https://fast.ai) founder [Jeremy Howard](https://twitter.com/jeremyphoward) and [Sebastian Ruder](https://twitter.com/seb_ruder)), the [OpenAI transformer](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/openai-assets/research-covers/language-unsupervised/language_understanding_paper.pdf) (by OpenAI researchers [Radford](https://twitter.com/alecrad), [Narasimhan](https://twitter.com/karthik_r_n), [Salimans](https://twitter.com/timsalimans), and [Sutskever](https://twitter.com/ilyasut)), and the Transformer ([Vaswani et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)).

> **ULMFiT: Nailing down Transfer Learning in NLP**
>
> [ULMFiT introduced methods to effectively utilize a lot of what the model learns during pre-training](http://nlp.fast.ai/classification/2018/05/15/introducting-ulmfit.html) – more than just embeddings, and more than contextualized embeddings. ULMFiT introduced a language model and a process to effectively fine-tune that language model for various tasks.
>
> NLP finally had a way to do transfer learning probably as well as Computer Vision could.

[MultiFiT: Efficient Multi-lingual Language Model Fine-tuning](http://nlp.fast.ai/classification/2019/09/10/multifit.html) by Sebastian Ruder et al. MultiFiT extends ULMFiT to make it more efficient and more suitable for language modelling beyond English. ([EMNLP 2019 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.04761))
